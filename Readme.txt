baposter Landscape Poster

Original description:
This poster template features a large header with space for two logos to either side of the title and neatly divides poster content into separate boxes with clear headings in each one. The landscape layout features four columns which can be merged into larger blocks if required, such as in the Results 1, Conclusion and Future Research sections of the template. Merged blocks allow more space for showing off results while blocks taking up one column are ideal for small paragraphs of text or details about the research. The default background color of the template is white in order to save on printing costs and the blue spectrum used in the headers of content boxes and for their borders to liven the poster up. All colors can be easily changed within the template. Examples of a table, figure, equation, list, flow chart and bibliography are present in the template to provide a starting point for any requirement you may have for your own poster.
